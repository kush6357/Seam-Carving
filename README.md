# Seam-Carving
Implement a content-aware image resizing algorithm.
Example
Below the first image is the original 505-by-287 pixel image; the second image is the result after removing 150 vertical seams, resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.
